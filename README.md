# Welcome to My Machine learning World
Before we start we must install python3.
## installing
#### Macosx
````
brew install python3
````
if you don't have 'brew' command in your macos you can install from this website (https://brew.sh/index_th.html)

#### Window
For window you can get python for this website (https://www.python.org)

## NumPy
In this code we need to install numpy because NumPy can help we to use array and some mathematic function example exponential,sign,metrix cross ,etc
we can install NumPy by

#### Macos
````
pip install numpy
````
#### Window
For window you can download numpy from this website (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/user/install.html#id4)
## Mathematical Functions
In machine learning we use mathematic function for analysis and calculate in this code i use basically mathematic function "step function" and "sigmoid function" you can learn these function from (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeavisideStepFunction.html) and (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SigmoidFunction.html)

## IDE
* [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - i use this ide because can complie and run.
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) - fast ide.
